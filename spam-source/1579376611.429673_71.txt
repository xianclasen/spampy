Fearing a repeat of the deadly violence that engulfed Charlottesville more than two years ago, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary emergency Wednesday banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square ahead of a massive rally planned next week over gun rights. The governor, a Democrat, announced the plans at a news conference Wednesday afternoon because of credible threats of potential violence and extremism, one official said. Northams announcement comes days after Democratic leaders used a rules committee to ban guns inside the Capitol and a legislative office building. That ban did not include Capitol grounds, which are under the governors control and are where a huge number of gun-rights advocates are expected to rally Monday. One official said Northam decided to ban all guns from the grounds of Capitol Square after receiving reports for weeks about inflammatory The official said the state does not have intelligence that the groups are planning a specific act of violence, but said Northam has grown increasingly concerned about numerous ominous-sounding postings on media from forces outside Virginia. The official cited one posting that included a photo of an AR-15 and said there are great sight angles from certain buildings near Capitol Square.Virginia law enforcement officials have been criticized for their planning and response to a deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville that involved heavily armed protesters. One woman was killed and several more were injured when a car into a group of counterprotesters. Northams declaration will also ban items like helmets and shields, items that some white nationalists carried in Charlottesville. Its unclear how long the temporary ban will be in effect.





Its only natural to worry about the things we care about, especially when it comes to things as costly as cars and vehicles.
