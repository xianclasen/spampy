Dear Friend,

Please i want you to read this letter very carefully and i must
apologize for berging this message into your mail box without any
formal introduction due to the urgency and confidential of this issue
and i know that this message will come to you as a surprise, Please
this is not a joke and i will not like you to joke with it.I am
Mr.Suleman Bello, a staff in African Development Bank (A.D.B)
Ouagadougou, Burkina faso West Africa.I discovered existing dormant
account for years. When I discovered that there had been neither
continuation nor withdrawals from this account for this long period
and according to the laws and constitution guiding this banking
institution, any unserviceable account for more than (7) seven years,
that fund will be transferred to national treasury as unclaimed fund.

I Hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust and confident
that i am about to extablish with you for the mutual benefit of you
and i.I need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of $10.5
)million usd into your account within 7 banking days. This money has
been dormant for years in our Bank, and The request of foreigner in
this transaction is necessary because our late customer was a
foreigner and a burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a
foreigner.Because of the static of this transaction I want you to
stand as the next of kin so that our bank will accord you the
recognition and have the fund transferred to your account.

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with further information
and more deities that will help you understand the transaction. I am
expecting your urgent response to enable me inform you on how the
business will be executed. Please I would like you to keep this
transaction confidential and as a top secret or delete if you are not
interested.

Thanks
Mr.Suleman Bello.
