Throughout its history, ensemble coding been known by many names. Interest in the theory began to emerge in the early 20th century.[8] In its earliest years, ensemble coding was known as Gestalt grouping.[8] In 1923, Max Wertheimer, a Gestalt psychology theorist, was addressing how humans perceive their visual world holistically rather than individually.[16] Gestaltists argued that in object perception, the individual object features were either lost or difficult to perceive and therefore the grouped object was the favored percept.[17] Although Gestaltists helped define some of the central principles of object perception, research into modern ensemble coding did not occur until many years later.[citation needed] In 1971, Norman Anderson was one of the earliest to conduct explicit ensemble coding research.[3][18] Anderson's research into social ensemble coding showed that individuals described by two positive terms were rated more favorably than individuals described by two positive terms and two negative terms.[19] This research on impression formation demonstrated that a weighted mean or average captures how information is integrated rather than the summation.[19] Additional research during this time explored ensemble coding in group attractiveness,[20] shopping preferences,[21] and the perceived badness of criminals.[22] The current era Findings by Dan Ariely in 2001 were the first data to support the modern theories of ensemble coding. Ariely used novel experimental paradigms he labeled "mean discrimination" and "member identification" to examine how sets of objects are perceived. He conducted three studies involving shape ensembles that varied in size. Across all studies participants were able to accurately encode the mean size of the ensemble of objects, but they were inaccurate when asked if a certain object was a part of the set. Ariely's findings were the first that found statistical summary information emerge in the visual perception of grouped objects.[23] Consistent with Ariely's findings,[23] follow-up research conducted by Sang Chul Chong and Anne Treisman in 2003 provided evidence that participants are engaging in summary statistical processes. Their research revealed that participant's maintained high accuracy in encoding the mean size of the stimuli even with short stimuli presentations as low as 50 milliseconds, memory delays, and object distribution differences.[24] Additional research has demonstrated that ensemble coding is not limited to the mean size of objects in the ensemble,[23] but that additional content is extracted, such as average line orientation,[25] average spatial location,[26] average number,[27] and statistical summaries such as the variances[28] are detected. Observers are also able to extract accurate perceptual summaries of high-level features such as the average direction of eye gaze of group

Throughout its history, ensemble coding been known by many names. Interest =
in the theory began to emerge in the early 20th century.[8] In its earliest=
 years, ensemble coding was known as Gestalt grouping.[8] In 1923, Max Wert=
heimer, a Gestalt psychology theorist, was addressing how humans perceive t=
heir visual world holistically rather than individually.[16] Gestaltists ar=
gued that in object perception, the individual object features were either =
lost or difficult to perceive and therefore the grouped object was the favo=
red percept.[17] Although Gestaltists helped define some of the central pri=
nciples of object perception, research into modern ensemble coding did not =
occur until many years later.[citation needed]

In 1971, Norman Anderson was one of the earliest to conduct explicit ensemb=
le coding research.[3][18] Anderson's research into social ensemble coding =
showed that individuals described by two positive terms were rated more fav=
orably than individuals described by two positive terms and two negative te=
rms.[19] This research on impression formation demonstrated that a weighted=
 mean or average captures how information is integrated rather than the sum=
mation.[19] Additional research during this time explored ensemble coding i=
n group attractiveness,[20] shopping preferences,[21] and the perceived bad=
ness of criminals.[22]

The current era
Findings by Dan Ariely in 2001 were the first data to support the modern th=
eories of ensemble coding. Ariely used novel experimental paradigms he labe=
led "mean discrimination" and "member identification" to examine how sets o=
f objects are perceived. He conducted three studies involving shape ensembl=
es that varied in size. Across all studies participants were able to accura=
tely encode the mean size of the ensemble of objects, but they were inaccur=
ate when asked if a certain object was a part of the set. Ariely's findings=
 were the first that found statistical summary information emerge in the vi=
sual perception of grouped objects.[23]

Consistent with Ariely's findings,[23] follow-up research conducted by Sang=
 Chul Chong and Anne Treisman in 2003 provided evidence that participants a=
re engaging in summary statistical processes. Their research revealed that =
participant's maintained high accuracy in encoding the mean size of the sti=
muli even with short stimuli presentations as low as 50 milliseconds, memor=
y delays, and object distribution differences.[24]

Additional research has demonstrated that ensemble coding is not limited to=
 the mean size of objects in the ensemble,[23] but that additional content =
is extracted, such as average line orientation,[25] average spatial locatio=
n,[26] average number,[27] and statistical summaries such as the variances[=
28] are detected. Observers are also able to extract accurate perceptual su=
mmaries of high-level features such as the average direction of eye gaze of=
