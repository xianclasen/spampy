 upon the subject, for he would on no account consent that Cleopatra shou=
ld suffer any injury whatever. This refusal on the part of her husband to=
 comply with her request only inflamed Tryphena's insane resentment and a=
nger the more. In fact, the earnestness with which he espoused her sister=
's cause, and the interest which he seemed to feel in her fate, aroused T=
ryphena's jealousy. She believed, or pretended to believe, that her husba=
nd was influenced by a sentiment of love in so warmly defending her. The =
object of her hate, from being simply an enemy, became now, in her view, =
a rival, and she resolved that, at all hazards, she should be destroyed. =
She accordingly ordered a body of desperate soldiers to break into the te=
mple and seize her. Cleopatra fled in terror to the altar, and clung to i=
t with such convulsive force that the soldiers cut her hands off before t=
hey could tear her away, and then, maddened by her resistance and the sig=
ht of blood, they stabbed her again and again upon the floor of the templ=
e, where she fell. The appalling shrieks with which the wretched victim f=
illed the air in the first moments of her flight and her terror, subsided=
, as her life ebbed away, into the most awful imprecations of the judgmen=
ts of Heaven upon the head of the unnatural sister whose implacable hate =
had destroyed her."/></a><br />
