Howdy and a quick question:

Do you have a survival farm that can provide an unlimited supply of food post collapse? If you look at Venezuela, with people eating their pets as a last resort, it's obvious that things there will take years, if not over a decade to come back to normal.

Now, if average folks are desperate enough loot food trucks and even steal zoo animals in order, how long would your garden or farm remain intact?
