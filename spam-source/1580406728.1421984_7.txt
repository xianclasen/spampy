CLAIM Your Trump 2020 Commemorative Golf Ball!

Shaktimaan was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with Rajshri Productions. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled Akash. In November 1997, Screen reported quoted him: "I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever Power Zone came on, shooting with imaginary laser guns, or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made Shaktimaan I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with SFX tricks." Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, "In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are Superman or Spiderman, who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a yagna, and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear. And when he is not in his super-hero avataar he's a bumbling photographer who always misses scoop much to the chagrin of his boss Kitu Gidwani." He added that the attire of Shaktimaan's alter ego, "complete with buck teeth and floppy hair" was inspired by American comedian Jerry Lewis.

Having wanted the "best ever" special effects seen on Indian television, following the series' airing, Khanna felt that it " short of  expectations". He added, "When I had planned the serial I wanted the kind of special effects seen in Superman, Spiderman and Terminator. Maybe I was too ambitious. Computer graphics has just arrived in India and there is lack of trained professionals here." He further said, the special effects for each episode costed him ?2 lakh, and ?10 lakh overall.

The series was sponsored by Parle-G from its first episode.[4Sweetness is produced by the presence of sugars, some proteins, and other substances such as alcohols like anethol, glycerol and propylene glycol, saponins such as glycyrrhizin, artificial sweeteners (organic compounds with a variety of structures), and lead compounds such as lead acetate.[citation needed] It is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group.[citation needed] Many foods can be perceived as sweet despite of the sugar content, alcoholic drinks can taste sweet despite of having sugar or not, some plants such as liquorice, anise or stevia are sometimes used as sweeteners. Rebaudioside A is a steviol glycoside coming from stevia that is 200 times sweeter than sugar. Lead acetate and other lead compounds were used as sweeteners, mostly for wine, until lead poisoning became known. Romans used to deliberately boil the must inside of lead vessels to make a sweeter wine. Sweetness is detected by a variety of G protein-coupled receptors coupled to a G protein that acts as an intermediary in the communication between taste bud and brain, gustducin. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for sweet sensing in humans and other animals.
