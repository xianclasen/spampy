He is another devil sent by Tamraj Kilvish to kill Shaktimaan. He is completely made from fire and Tamraj Kilvish awoke him from thousands years of his sleeping to kill Shaktimaan. He first spread destruction in the city by showing himself as Ranjeet Singh, Shaktimaan's father, but dies due to the attack of nitrogen gas which him, but he again re-emerges. Shaktimaan later killed him with nitrogen gas.

Lightman

He was created by Dr. Jackal when he was rescued from jail by Sahab, one of the main enemies of Shaktimaan. He released him from prison to help him to kill Shaktimaan, he created Lightman by cloning one hair of Shaktimaan and sunlight. Later Shaktimaan took all light from Lightman and took it inside his body which made him extremely weak but he managed to fly to sun and transferred the light in the sun.

Plastica

The most dangerous creation of Dr. Jackal, she is made of plastic and releases extremely dangerous poisonous gas which kills people in seconds. She can stretch any part of her body and there is no way to kill her.

Froga

He is half-human half frog, he is really powerful and has a really long and sticky tongue which is really dangerous. His tongue is his main power source which he uses to catch its prey. He (along with Visdhar, Behroopia and Chinksu) spread a lot of destruction in the city but was defeated by Shaktiman and three other powerful Suryanshis.

Stone-man

He was created by Kapala a servant of Tamraj Kilvish using his magic skull. He is made entirely of stone. His glance can turn any inanimate object to stone. On humans, the glance can only petrify them. His glance follows the rules of electro-magnetic radiation and can be reflected. The Stone-man kidnaps the Santa Claus from a party and disguises himself as the Santa. When he starts attacking Shaktimaan at the party, Shaktimaan cleverly evades his glances. Shaktimaan uses a metal tray to turn his glance back to him, petrifying the Stone-man. He then changes switches appearances with Stone-man and deceives Kapala into attacking him. Kapala is hurt badly and Shaktimaan uses this opportunity to destroy the magic skull of Kapala. The stone-man disappears when the skull is destroyed.

<div style="width:600px;font-family:Arial;padding:10px;">If you&#39;ve talked to any expert on neuropathy or done even basic research on the condition &ndash; you&#39;ll know that vitamin B12 is perhaps the most important vitamin for boosting your nerve health.<br />
<br />
So why would I tell you that it won&#39;t help with your neuropathy?<br />
<br />
It&#39;s not that B12 CAN&#39;T help boost nerve health and ease neuropathy. If you find it the right form, it absolutely can AND will help. The problem is that most of the B12 vitamins you&#39;ll find at your grocery store or online aren&#39;t the right form of B12 for neuropathy.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, most manufacturers are trying to boost their bottom line by selling a cheaper, less effective form of the vitamins they&#39;re pushing.<br />
<br />
This is especially true of vitamin B12.<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re not already taking a B12 supplement, you should start today.<br />
<br />
But you need to take the right one &ndash; otherwise you&#39;re throwing your money away.<br />
<br />
