Another powerful space guard. She first came to the earth in her space, when Shaktimaan tried to stop her he was attacked by powerful rays from her space. Like Mr. Subkar electricity and bullets do not harm her, her mind is faster than computer and she can also fly. She (along with Mr. Subkar) is the owner of Inter Gallactic Prison. Sheena and Mr. Subkar were the first people who saw Shaheb's real face and made him arrested by the police. Later in a spaceship, they follow Jaikal but Jaikal blasts their spaceship and Mr. Subkar and Sheena are badly injured and turn. So Shaktimaan finds a special flower to save them and in the process, he catches Dr. Jackal and then freezes him along with the others in the Inter-Galactic Prison (A prison made in galaxy near the sun made by the space guards Mr. Subkar and Sheena). When Mr. Subkar and Sheena are saved they are about to leave Mayor of the city Kumar Ranjan comes and name them foreign spy living visas and do not allow them to go. Later to defame Shaktimaan he spreads a virus in the city and says it is done by the space guards. Also kidnaps Mr. Subkar and Sheena and tells its done by Shaktimaan and an arrest comes out for Shaktimaan, but Mr. Subkar and Sheena brings the truth by showing the real face of Kumar Ranjan.

Dr. Shishir

He is a really powerful Suryanshi or even one of the most powerful Suryanshis, he possesses telekinetic power and can bring anyone to himself and even no one can move if he catches them. He lives with Sanjeev Mahashay at the secret places of Suryanshis in the city and even runs a hospital. He has also helped Shaktimaan many times in defeating Tamraj Kilvish's armies.

Vivek/Andhi and Abhimanyu

He is a really powerful Suryanshi he has the power of wind and it comes out from his eyes. He lives with Sanjeev Mahashay at the secret places of Suryanshis in the city and even runs a hospital. One blow from his mouth throws the person wherever he wants. He is later killed by Tamraj Kilvish but his brother Abhimanuv has same powers. He joins them and fills his place and also helped Shaktimaan many times in defeating Tamraj Kilvish's armies.

Abhinav/Vidyut

He is a really powerful Suryanshi he has the power of fire and fire rays comes out from his eyes. He lives with Sanjeev Mahashay at the secret places of Suryanshis in the city and even runs a hospital. He has also helped Shaktimaan many times in defeating Tamraj Kilvish's armies. He is also rarely shown using 'Murli-Magic', to ensnare his gurus to act upon his will.

Obviously, I can&rsquo;t make it for you but I honestly believe there are no accidents in life.<br />
