<span style=3D"display:none!important;mso-hide:all;">any years considered t=
he nervous system as an isolated entity and largely ignored influences of t=
he social environments in which humans and many animal species live. In fac=
t, we now recognize the considerable impact of social structures on the ope=
rations of the brain and body. These social factors operate on the individu=
al through a continuous interplay of neural, neuroendocrine, metabolic and =
immune factors on brain and body, in which the brain is the central regulat=
ory organ and also a malleable target of these factors.[3] Social neuroscie=
nce investigates the biological mechanisms that underlie social processes a=
nd behavior, widely considered one of the major problem areas for the neuro=
sciences in the 21st century, and applies concepts and methods of biology t=
o develop theories of social processes and behavior in the social and behav=
ioral sciences. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and =
methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses socia=
l and behavioral constructs and data to advance theories of neural organiza=
tion and function.[4][5]

Throughout most of the 20th century, social and biological explanations wer=
e widely viewed as incompatible. But advances in recent years have led to t=
he development of a new approach synthesized from the social and biological=
 sciences. The new field of social neuroscience emphasizes the complementar=
y relationship between the different levels of organization, spanning the s=
ocial and biological domains (e.g., molecular, cellular, system, person, re=
lational, collective, societal) and the use of multi-level analyses to fost=
er understanding of the mechanisms underlying the human mind and behavior.

Methods
A number of methods are used in social neuroscience to investigate the conf=
luence of neural and social processes. These methods draw from behavioral t=
echniques developed in social psychology, cognitive psychology, and neurops=
ychology, and are associated with a variety of neurobiological techniques i=
ncluding functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalograp=
hy (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), facial electromyography (EMG)=
, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography (EEG), ev=
ent-related potentials (ERPs), electrocardiograms, electromyograms, endocri=
nology, immunology, galvanic skin response (GSR), single-cell recording, an=
d studies of focal brain lesion patients.[6][7][8][9][10] In recent years, =
these methods have been complemented by virtual reality techniques (VR) and=
 hormonal measures. Animal models are also important to investigate the put=
ative role of specific brain structures, circuits, or processes (e.g., the =
reward system and drug addiction). In addition, quantitative meta-analyses =
are important to move beyond idiosyncrasies of individual studies, and neur=
