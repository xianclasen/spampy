lians or their close relatives are represented in the Maastrichtian fossil records, of which five died out prior to the K–Pg boundary.[80] Five families have both Maastrichtian and Paleocene fossil representatives. All of the surviving families of crocodyliforms inhabited freshwater and terrestrial environments—except for the Dyrosauridae, which lived in freshwater and marine locations. Approximately 50% of crocodyliform representatives survived across the K–Pg boundary, the only apparent trend being that no large crocodiles survived.[29] Crocodyliform survivability across the boundary may have resulted from their aquatic niche and ability to burrow, which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at the boundary.[58] Jouve and colleagues suggested in 2008 that juvenile marine crocodyliforms lived in freshwater environments as do modern marine crocodile juveniles, which would have helped them survive where other marine reptiles became extinct; freshwater environments were not so strongly affected by the K–Pg extinction event as marine environments were.[81] Pterosaurs One family of pterosaurs, Azhdarchidae, was definitely present in the Maastrichtian, and it likely became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a declining group that contained ten families during the mid-Cretaceous. Several other pterosaur lineages may have been present during the Maastrichtian, such as the ornithocheirids, pteranodontids, nyctosaurids, as well as a possible tapejarid, though they are represented by fragmentary remains that are difficult to assign to any given group.[82][83] While this was occurring, modern birds were undergoing diversification; traditionally it was thought that they replaced archaic birds and pterosaur groups, possibly due to direct competition, or they simply filled empty niches,[58][84][85] but there is no correlation between pterosaur and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition hypothesis,[86] and small pterosaurs were present in the Late Cretaceous.[87] At least some niches previously held by birds were reclaimed by pterosaurs prior to the K–Pg event.[88] Birds Most paleontologists regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs (see Origin of birds). It is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithiforms.[89] Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and ratite bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs.[90] Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K–Pg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there. A small fraction of the Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving rise to today's birds.[17][91] The only bird group known for certain to have survived the K–Pg boundary is the Aves.[17] Avians may have been able to survive the extinction as a result of their abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes, or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.[58] The open niche space and relative scarcity of predators following the K-Pg extinction allowed for adaptive radiation of various avian groups. Ratites, for example, rapidly diversified in the early Paleogene and are believed to have convergently developed flightlessness at least three to six times, often fulfilling the niche space for large herbivores once occupied by non-avian dinosaurs.[25][92][93] Non-avian dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus skeleton in museum display Tyrannosaurus was among the dinosaurs living on Earth before the extinction. Excluding a few controversial claims, scientists agree that all non-avian dinosaurs became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. The dinosaur fossil record has been interpreted to show both a decline in diversity and no decline in diversity during the last few million years of the Cretaceous, and it may be that the quality of the dinosaur fossil record is simply not good enough to permit resea

dergoing diversification; traditionally it was thought that they replaced a=
rchaic birds and pterosaur groups, possibly due to direct competition, or t=
hey simply filled empty niches,[58][84][85] but there is no correlation bet=
ween pterosaur and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition h=
ypothesis,[86] and small pterosaurs were present in the Late Cretaceous.[87=
] At least some niches previously held by birds were reclaimed by pterosaur=
s prior to the K=E2=80=93Pg event.[88]

Birds
Most paleontologists regard birds as the only surviving dinosaurs (see Orig=
in of birds). It is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct, in=
cluding then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithif=
orms.[89] Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior=
 to the K=E2=80=93Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and ratite bird rela=
tives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs.[90] Large collections of bird fos=
sils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence=
 for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K=E2=
=80=93Pg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence =
that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there.

A small fraction of the Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving=
 rise to today's birds.[17][91] The only bird group known for certain to ha=
ve survived the K=E2=80=93Pg boundary is the Aves.[17] Avians may have been=
 able to survive the extinction as a result of their abilities to dive, swi=
m, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can buil=

helter from the environmental effects at the K=E2=80=93Pg boundary. Long-te=
rm survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological=
 niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.[58] The open niche=
 space and relative scarcity of predators following the K-Pg extinction all=
owed for adaptive radiation of various avian groups. Ratites, for example, =
rapidly diversified in the early Paleogene and are believed to have converg=
ently developed flightlessness at least three to six times, often fulfillin=
g the niche space for large herbivores once occupied by non-avian dinosaurs=
