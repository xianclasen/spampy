         K1EPCHearingHearing is also a distance sense The action of its stimulus is mechanical which is to say that the vibrations produced in the air by the sounding body are finally transmitted by the mechanism of the middle ear to the inner ear Here the impulse is conveyed through the liquid of the internal ear to the nerve endings as so many tiny blows which produce the nerve current carried to the brain by the auditory nerveWithout habit personality could not exist for we could never do a thing twice alike and hence would be a new person each succeeding moment The acts which give us our own peculiar individuality are our habitual actsthe little things that do themselves moment by moment without care or attention and are the truest and best expression of our real selves Probably no one of us could be very sure which arm he puts into the sleeve or which foot he puts into the shoe first and yet each of us certainly formed the habit long ago of doing these things in a certain way We might not be able to describe just how we hold knife and fork and spoon and yet each has his own characteristic and habitual way of handling them We sit down and get up in some characteristic way and the very poise of our heads and attitudes of our bodies are the result of habit We get sleepy and wake up become hungry and thirsty at certain hours through force of habit We form the habit of liking a certain chair or nook or corner or path or desk and then seek this to the exclusion76 of all others We habitually use a particular pitch of voice and type of enunciation in speaking and this becomes one of our characteristic marks or we form the habit of using barbarisms or solecisms of language in youth and these cling to us and become an inseparable part of us later in lifeReply shadylaneFig 1Trough for Dipping Bedstead Frames and other Large WorkAlixs AvatarEd What is your favorite softdrinkBut Charles VIII continued his road not without some uneasiness The sight of the young prince on his deathbed had moved him deeply for at the bottom of his heart he was convinced that Ludovico Sforza was his murderer and a murderer might very well be a traitor He was going forward into an unfamiliar country with a declared enemy in front of him and a doubtful friend behind he was now at the entrance to the mountains and as his army had no store of provisions and only lived from hand to mouth a forced delay however short would mean famine In front of him was Fivizzano nothing it is true but a village surrounded by walls but beyond Fivizzano lay Sarzano and Pietra Santa both of them considered impregnable fortresses worse than this they were coming into a part of the country that was especially unhealthy in October had no natural product except oil and even procured its own corn from neighbouring provinces it was plain that a whole army might perish there in a few days either from scarcity of food or from the unwholesome air both of which were more disastrous than the impediments offered at every step by the nature of the ground The situation was grave but the pride of Piero dei Medici came once more to the rescue of the fortunes of Charles lover hu VIIIWhile attention is no doubt partly a natural gift yet there is probably no power of the mind more susceptible to training than is attention And with attention as with every other power of body and mind the secret of its development lies in its use Stated briefly the only way to train attention is by attending No amount of theorizing or resolving can take the place of practice in the actual process of attendingThe pleasure of teaching her to love surpassed the delightful fragrance of all the perfumes in the worldNeurogliaOut of this simple structural element the neurone the entire nervous system is built True the neurones are held in place and perhaps insulated by a kind of soft cement called neuroglia But this seems to possess no strictly nervous function The number of the36 microscopic neurones required to make up the mass of the brain cord and peripheral nervous system is far beyond our mental grasp It is computed that the brain and cord contain some 3000 millions of themInner Nature of the Mind Not Revealed by IntrospectionWe are not to be too greatly discouraged if even by introspection we cannot discover exactly what the mind is No one knows what electricity is though nearly everyone uses it in one form or another We study the dynamo the motor and the conductors through which electricity manifests itself We observe its effects in light heat and mechanical power and so learn the laws which govern its operations But we are almost as far from understanding its true nature as were the ancients who knew nothing of its uses The dynamo does not create the electricity but only furnishes the5 conditions which make it possible for electricity to manifest itself in doing the worlds work Likewise the brain or nervous system does not create the mind but it furnishes the machine through which the mind works We may study the nervous system and learn something of the conditions and limitations under which the mind operates but this is not studying the mind itself As in the case of electricity what we know about the mind we must learn through the activities in which it manifests itselfthese we can know for they are in the experience of all It is then only by studying these processes of consciousness that we come to know the laws which govern the mind and its development What it is that thinks and feels and wills in us is too hard a problem for us hereindeed has been too hard a problem for the philosophers through the ages But the thinking and feeling and willing we can watch as they occur and hence lover hu come to know</span>
