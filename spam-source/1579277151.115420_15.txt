Lateral (from Latin lateralis, meaning 'to the side') refers to the sides of an animal, as in "left lateral" and "right lateral". The term medial (from Latin medius, meaning 'middle') is used to refer to structures close to the centre of an organism, called the "median plane". For example, in a human, imagine a line down the center of the body from the head though the navel and going between the legsâ€” the medial side of the foot would be the big toe side; the medial side of the knee would be the side adjacent to the other knee. To describe the sides of the knees touching each other would be "right medial" and "left medial".

The terms "left" and "right" are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives (Latin: dexter; "right", Latin: sinister; "left"). However, as left and right sides are mirror images, using these words is somewhat confusing, as structures are duplicated on both sides. For example, it is very confusing to say the dorsal fin of a dolphin is "right of" the left pectoral fin, but is "left of" the right eye, but much easier and clearer to say "the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins".

Terms derived from lateral include:

    Contralateral (from Latin contra, meaning 'against'): on the side opposite to another structure. For example, the right arm and leg are represented by the left, i.e., contralateral side of the forebrain.
    Ipsilateral (from Latin ipse, meaning 'same'): on the same side as another structure. For example, the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg.
    Bilateral (from Latin bis, meaning 'twice'): on both sides of the body. For example, bilateral orchiectomy (removal of testes on both sides of the body's axis) is surgical castration.
    Unilateral (from Latin unus, meaning 'one'): on one side of the body. For example, unilateral paresis is hemiparesis.

Terms derived from medial include:

    Inferomedial (from Latin inferus, meaning 'lower'): lower and in or near the midline. For example, the human nose is inferomedial to the eyes.
    Superomedial (from Latin superus, meaning 'above'): above and toward the midline. For example, the human nose is superomedial to the mouth.

Varus and valgus correspond to medial and lateral, respectively, regarding the distal segment's vector relative to the proximal segment's vector.
