Kekda man (Crab man) is one of the two dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Jonk Jonkaa). He is a clone created by Dr. Jackal by fusing cells of crab and a kidnapped Suryanshi. Dr. Jackal managed to twist the mind of the pure Suryanshi to become the Kekda man. He can breathe fire which contains an extremely dangerous poison that even impeded Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan left an illusion of him behind and narrowly escaped. Because he returns with only the illusion, Kekda man is destroyed by his short tempered creator.

Jonk Jonkaa

Jonk (leech) is one of the two most dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Kekda Man); He was created by fusing genes of humans and alien leech from Mars. He has the power to eat any form of matter and grow larger in size. He was killed by Geeta and the campers using salt. Shaktimaan is however captured in a flying prison in the process.

Evil clone Shaktimaan

After capturing Shaktimaan, Dr. Jackal makes a clone of him, but twists his mind to be a servant of darkness. The evil clone is created stronger than Shaktimaan, and is unleashed on the world. When the real Shaktimaan escapes his prison, he challenges the evil clone to a fight. He then captures the clone and sends him into deep space.

Shalaka

Shalaka is a cat girl who has pledged to eliminate Shaktimaan. She first appears in episode 125 of the series in which she tries to harm Geeta. She is an accomplice of Tamraj Kilvish. She has a sister named Shaliyaa. When she sees the cat Mani caressing Shaktimaan, she hurls it to death. She later realises that the cat was her sister, Shaliyaa.

Teemiraa

She was another devil magician sent by Tamraaj to kill Shaktimaan in childhood but she failed. Tamraaj tortured her in fire for several years for this. Later he again give her a chance to kill Shaktimaan with a warning but Teemiraa was planning to kill both Shaktimaan and Tamraaj Kilvish. Whenever she drinks blood of any human body she becomes young. At last Kilvish kills her for her misbehaves.

Matandeeka

She was a devil creature works for Kilvish, she hitches somebody on road and kills him brutally by taking his spirit. She wants to become powerful, so she goes in front of Kilvish for her request. Kilvish tells her to Kill Shaktimaan and she will become what she want. Her look was mostly similar to Teemiraa, she wears red dress and also the background score of Teemiraa was played on her.
