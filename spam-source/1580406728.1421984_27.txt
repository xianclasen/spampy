Because of how it looks I call this brand new survival tool the "survival accordion."

No, it doesn't play music...but all the crazy features packed inside it will seriously impress you.

See it here.

Want to know the coolest thing this new tool does? It grabs free energy from the atmosphere and turns it into free battery power you can use to charge portable electronics.

Oh yeah...it also uses that free energy to power another advanced tool built right inside.

Probably the most amazing thing this tool does is replace 4 survival tools (see which ones here
http://www.portableback.us/l/lt12OH3619O90RK/1253N1701Q3109H108P19399122LS1062422927/qs/?email=f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
And the reason I call it a survival accordion?

Well, it's kind of hard to explain...so I made a short little video on the next page to show you how it works.
 
A few other things this new tool will do for you:

Help you save money
Will make a bug out bag much lighter
Turns camping and or hiking into a much safer activity
Makes moving around the house at night easier than ever
Will make a great gift for men, women and children
And so much more!

Tom Tower is a bell tower in Oxford, England, named after its bell, Great Tom. It is over Tom Gate, on St Aldates, the main entrance of Christ Church, Oxford, which leads into Tom Quad. This square tower with an octagonal lantern and facetted ogee dome was designed by Christopher Wren and built 1681–82. The strength of Oxford architectural tradition and Christ Church's connection to its founder, Henry VIII, motivated the decision to complete the gatehouse structure, left unfinished by Cardinal Wolsey at the date of his fall from power in 1529, and which had remained roofless since. Wren made a case for working in a Late Gothic style—that it "ought to be Gothick to agree with the Founders worke"[1]—a style that had not been seen in a prominent building for a hundred and fifty years, making Tom Tower a lonely precursor[2] of the Gothic Revival that got underway in the mid-18th century.[3] Wren never came to supervise the structure as it was being erected by the stonemason he had recommended, Christopher Kempster of Burford.[4] Tom Tower seen from immediately adjacent to the St Aldates entrance to Tom Quad Tom Gate, the main entrance to Christ Church, beneath Tom Tower, looking in towards Tom Quad. In 1732–34, when William Kent was called upon to make sympathetic reconstruction of the east range of Clock Court in Wolsey's Tudor Hampton Court Palace, he naturally turned to the precedent of Tom Tower for his "central ogee dome with its coronet of pilaster-like gothick finials".[5] The tower of Dunster House at Harvard University is a direct imitation of Tom Tower, though its details have been Georgianised, and stones from Christ Church are installed in one of the house's main entryways.
