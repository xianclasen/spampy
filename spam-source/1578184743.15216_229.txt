fore the formal start of naming, tropical cyclones were often named after places, objects, or saints' feast days on which they occurred.[8] The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907.[8] This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of World War II for the Western Pacific.[8] Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.[8] At present, tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven warning centers and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to facilitate the effective communication of forecasts and storm-related hazards to the general public.[9] This is especially important when multiple storms are occurring simultaneously in the same ocean basin.[9] Names are generally assigned in order from predetermined lists, once they produce one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65 km/h (40 mph).[1][4][5] However, standards vary from basin to basin, with some systems named in the Western Pacific when they develop into tropical depressions or enter PAGASA's area of responsibility.[3] Within the Southern Hemisphere, systems must be characterized by a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are named.[5][6] Any member of the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane, typhoon and tropical cyclone committees can request that the name of a tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming lists.[1][2][6] A name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the system has acquired a special notoriety, such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage, impact, or for other special reasons.[1] A replacement name is then submitted to the committee concerned and voted upon, but these names can be rejected and replaced with another name for various reasons:[1][2] these reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name, the similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names, and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social media.[1][10] PAGASA also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones when they have caused at least â‚±1 billion in damage or have caused at least 300 de

<span style=3D"color:#FFFFFF;font-size:6px;">fore the formal start of namin=
g, tropical cyclones were often named after places, objects, or saints' fea=
st days on which they occurred.[8] The credit for the first usage of person=
al names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Governmen=
t Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named systems between 1887 and 1907.[8]=
 This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for se=
veral years after Wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of=
 World War II for the Western Pacific.[8] Formal naming schemes have subseq=
uently been introduced for the North Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western an=
d Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean=
.[8]

At present, tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven warning=
 centers and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to facilitate th=
e effective communication of forecasts and storm-related hazards to the gen=
eral public.[9] This is especially important when multiple storms are occur=
ring simultaneously in the same ocean basin.[9] Names are generally assigne=
d in order from predetermined lists, once they produce one, three, or ten-m=
inute sustained wind speeds of more than 65 km/h (40 mph).[1][4][5] However=
, standards vary from basin to basin, with some systems named in the Wester=
n Pacific when they develop into tropical depressions or enter PAGASA's are=
a of responsibility.[3] Within the Southern Hemisphere, systems must be cha=
racterized by a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the=
 center before they are named.[5][6]

Any member of the World Meteorological Organization's hurricane, typhoon an=
d tropical cyclone committees can request that the name of a tropical cyclo=
ne be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming lists.[=
1][2][6] A name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of membe=
rs agree that the system has acquired a special notoriety, such as causing =
a large number of deaths and amounts of damage, impact, or for other specia=
l reasons.[1] A replacement name is then submitted to the committee concern=
ed and voted upon, but these names can be rejected and replaced with anothe=
r name for various reasons:[1][2] these reasons include the spelling and pr=
onunciation of the name, the similarity to the name of a recent tropical cy=
clone or on another list of names, and the length of the name for modern co=
mmunication channels such as social media.[1][10] PAGASA also retires the n=
