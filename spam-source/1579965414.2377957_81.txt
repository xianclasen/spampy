Sanjeev Mahashay

The Chief head of all the Suryanshis places in the city. He first met Shaktimaan as Gangadhar when he lost his memory. He is a genius and is very powerful, with the help of his brain power he can break anything and even kill anyone. He has the power of Earth and his voice reaches till the end of the earth wherever he want he is the head of a hospital.

Jwaala and Euroo

They are aliens from Sudoku planet. They landed on earth to save their lives from the three evil aliens who wants to destroy everything. Later Dr. Jackal kidnaps them, to use their powers for darkness (andhera).

Kamini

Nupur Alankaar plays the role of Kaamini, a flirty, filmy gossip writer in the newspaper Aaj ki Aawaz. She often attempts to flirt with Gangaadhar and fires taunts at Geeta.

Shailaa

Toyman is like a friend for Shailaa. But Toyman loves her. After using poisonous colours in toys many children die. As a result, Toyman is sent to jail. Shailaa begins hating him and never wants to see his ugly face again. She is later married to a new man. When Toyman discovers this, he finds her and kills her along with her whole family.

Shalu

Shalu is a small-time thief turned fan of Shaktimaan. Her accomplice is Tilly, another crook. She is someone who has lost faith in the system and adopted a life of crime. However her adoration for Shaktimaan starts cultivating good thoughts in her. She has a tomboy personality and is courageous enough to take on multiple goons. She has a moderate skill in hand-to-hand combat.
Fame

Shaktimaan is the defender of the truth and justice as well as a role model for his television audience, even going so far as to lecture viewers on hygiene, patriotism and education.

When Shaktimaan first aired on Doordarshan, there were a lot of controversies created as children set themselves on fire or jumped off buildings hoping that Shaktimaan would save them. In an effort to promote responsible behaviour among children, Mukesh Khanna spent a substantial part of the airtime in explaining to the children that the stunts shown on television were not real and should not be emulated. Khanna also stated that most of the controversies were fake and were raised in media to undermine its popularity.
