pg" alt=3D"At length, after various other intrigues and much secret manag=
ement, Berenice succeeded in a second negotiation, and married a prince, =
or a pretended prince, from some country of Asia Minor, whose name was Ar=
chelaus. She was better pleased with this second husband than she had bee=
n with the first, and she began, at last, to feel somewhat settled and es=
tablished on her throne, and to be prepared, as she thought, to offer eff=
ectual resistance to her father in case he should ever attempt to return.=

"898" border=3D"0" alt=3D" Caesar immediately began to take a very strong=
 interest in Cleopatra's cause. He treated her personally with the fondes=
t attention, and it was impossible for her not to reciprocate in some deg=
ree the kind feeling with which he regarded her. It was, in fact, somethi=
ng altogether new to her to have a warm and devoted friend, espousing her=
 cause, tendering her protection, and seeking in every way to promote her=
 happiness. Her father had all his life neglected her. Her brother, of ye=
ars and understanding totally inferior to hers, whom she had been compell=
ed to make her husband, had become her mortal enemy. It is true that, in =
depriving her of her inheritance and expelling her from her native land, =
he had been only the tool and instrument of more designing men. This, how=
ever, far from improving the point of view from which she regarded him, m=
ade him appear not only hateful, but contemptible too. All the officers o=
f government, also, in the Alexandrian court had turned against her, beca=
use they had supposed that they could control her brother more easily if =
she were away. Thus she had always been surrounded by selfish, mercenary,=
 and implacable foes. Now, for the first time, she seemed to have a frien=
d. A protector had suddenly arisen to support and defend her,--a man of v=
ery alluring person and manners, of a very noble and generous spirit, and=
 of the very highest station. He loved her, and she could not refrain fro=
m loving him in return. She committed her cause entirely into his hands, =
confided to him all her interests, and gave herself up wholly into his po=
wer." /></a><br />
