Madhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.

Electric-man

He was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising friend from foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.

Kapala

Kapala is a corrupted tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shape shifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humor as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as a comic relief. This is in contrast to other villains who are stark and serious. He also has a very fragile ego and falls victim to taunts. His main accessory is a trident. Shaktimaan eventually turns him into stone and shatters him at one instance. However, in later episodes of Shaktimaan, he is shown resurrected back to life. He is played by Faqira.

Khali-Bali

Khali and Bali are two dwarvish green and red imps. Their names originate from the Urdu word Khalbali which means commotion. Throughout their appearances they constantly argue and reconcile with each other over inane reasons. They claim to eat humans but there is no evidence regarding the same. They can combine to form a single full size demon. This demon wears a green and red garb. Their power is insignificant when they are separated but when they both combine they become as physically strong as a full-fledged demon. Not much is shown regarding any psychic powers they possess.

<br />


THE RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THE TYPICAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CAUSES DIABETES IS WAY OFF.<br />


<br />


That sugar and insulin production are not the root problem, but rather its what the insulin makes your blood DO to your body that causes the issues.<br />


<br />


According to this new information, the sugar and INSULIN IN THE BLOOD WERE ACTUALLY CORRODING THE ORGANS INSIDE MY WIFE. This corrosion happens to the organs much LIKE AN OLD BOX OF SCREWS RUSTS over time.<br />
