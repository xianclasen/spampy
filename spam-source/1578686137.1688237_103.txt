Kakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread Andhera (darkness).

He was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.

The full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.

Natasha

Natasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of invisible man which may help defeating Shaktimaan.

Madhur

Madhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.
