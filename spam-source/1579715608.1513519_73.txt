hand to make sure we claim this fund and start a better life in your
country, so i have all information on how you will receive this credit
card without delay or disappointment.


I will front you as a bonified member of Mr. Nicholson family which we
make the board authority to believe you that truely you are his family
member to enable you claim the credit card with an immediate effect.
And also bear it in mind that if there is any question about this said
fund, am here to guid you, so please if you know you're not interested

favour by not repling back.


Now let me brief you on how you can receive the credit card, which it
will be delivered to you by DHL Courier Service and the amount of the
delivery is $360 dollar, and also the amount for the registration it
cost $620 dollar, so please tell me the amount you will be able to
handle to enable the successfulness of this business, please once
