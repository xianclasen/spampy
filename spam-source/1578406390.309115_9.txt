torical concept, or to a contemporary German definition of Central Europe. As an historical concept, the German term Mitteleuropa (or alternatively its literal translation into English, Middle Europe[35]) is an ambiguous German concept.[35] It is sometimes used in English to refer to an area somewhat larger than most conceptions of 'Central Europe'; it refers to territories under Germanic cultural hegemony until World War I (encompassing Austria–Hungary and Germany in their pre-war formations but usually excluding the Baltic countries north of East Prussia).[citation needed] According to Fritz Fischer Mitteleuropa was a scheme in the era of the Reich of 1871–1918 by which the old imperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, military and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East and from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus.[36] Later on, professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic "Drang nach Westen" (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a Mitteleuropa ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.[37] In Germany the connotation was also sometimes linked to the pre-war German provinces east of the Oder-Neisse line.[citation needed] The term "Mitteleuropa" conjures up negative historical associations among some elderly people, although the Germans have not played an exclusively negative role in the region.[38] Most Central European Jews embraced the enlightened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.[39] German-speaking Jews from turn of the 20th century Vienna, Budapest and Prague became representatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best, though the Nazi version of "Mitteleuropa" destroyed this kind of culture instead.[40] However, the term "Mitteleuropa" is now widely used again in German education and media without negative meaning, especially since the end of communism.

<div style=3D"color:#FFFFFF;font-size:6px;">torical concept, or to a contem=
porary German definition of Central Europe. As an historical concept, the G=
erman term Mitteleuropa (or alternatively its literal translation into Engl=
ish, Middle Europe[35]) is an ambiguous German concept.[35] It is sometimes=
 used in English to refer to an area somewhat larger than most conceptions =
of 'Central Europe'; it refers to territories under Germanic cultural hegem=
ony until World War I (encompassing Austria=E2=80=93Hungary and Germany in =
their pre-war formations but usually excluding the Baltic countries north o=
f East Prussia).[citation needed] According to Fritz Fischer Mitteleuropa w=
as a scheme in the era of the Reich of 1871=E2=80=931918 by which the old i=
mperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, m=
ilitary and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East an=
d from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus.[36]=
 Later on, professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic "Drang nac=
h Westen" (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a=
 Mitteleuropa ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.[37]

In Germany the connotation was also sometimes linked to the pre-war German =
provinces east of the Oder-Neisse line.[citation needed]

The term "Mitteleuropa" conjures up negative historical associations among =
some elderly people, although the Germans have not played an exclusively ne=
gative role in the region.[38] Most Central European Jews embraced the enli=
ghtened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.[39] German-speaking =
Jews from turn of the 20th century Vienna, Budapest and Prague became repre=
sentatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best=
, though the Nazi version of "Mitteleuropa" destroyed this kind of culture =
instead.[40] However, the term "Mitteleuropa" is now widely used again in G=
erman education and media without negative meaning, especially since the en=
d of communism. In fact, many people from the new states of Germany do not =
identify themselves as being part of Western Europe and therefore prefer th=
e term "Mitteleuropa".

Central Europe behind the Iron Curtain

  Politically independent CE states during Cold War: Finland, Austria, Yugo=
slavia[41]
Following World War II, large parts of Europe that were culturally and hist=
orically Western became part of the Eastern bloc. Czech author Milan Kunder=
a (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the "Tragedy of Central Eur=
ope" in the New York Review of Books.[42] Consequently, the English term Ce=
ntral Europe was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw=
 Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify =
them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe.[43] T=
his usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries s=
tarted to undergo transition.

The post-World War II period brought blocking of research on Central Europe=
 in the Eastern Bloc countries, as its every result proved the dissimilarit=
y of Central Europe, which was inconsistent with the Stalinist doctrine. On=
 the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United =
States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central E=
urope.[44] At the end of communism, publicists and historians in Central Eu=
rope, especially the anti-communist opposition, returned to their research.=
[45]

According to Karl A. Sinnhuber (Central Europe: Mitteleuropa: Europe Centra=
le: An Analysis of a Geographical Term)[41] most Central European states we=
